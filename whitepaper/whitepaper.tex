\subsection{Review of Rubik's Cubes}
Ah, the Rubik's Cube—the iconic toy that bedevils and delights in equal measure. Born from the ingenious mind of Ernő Rubik in 1974, it's more than just a puzzle. Forget mere child's play; this cube is chaos in the physical. Just kidding. To go from the state of chaos to order, one only needs to know a solving protocol of which many exist.

Max Park, the current world record holder (11 June 2023) for the 2-handed solve, obliterated the cube in a mind-blowing 3.13 seconds. Lucky scramble? Hardly. Yiheng Wang, who holds the world record average-of-five, clocks in at a dizzying 4.48 second mean solve time throughout the five solves.\footnote{An average-of-five is determined by taking the average of the three "middle" solves in a session of five scramble. In other words, the worst and best solve time are dropped from the calculation for the average.} And no, I won't depress you by mentioning his tender age of nine years old. But let's not divert. The Rubik's Cube--a mathematical marvel and a cipher waiting to be cracked. \\

Let's dive into the mechanics of the 3x3x3 puzzle. The cube boasts centers, edges, and corners. These single-colored center pieces serve as the invariant axis around which the peripheral cubies rotate. The six unit colors are yellow, blue, red, green, orange, and white.

\footnotetext{This number is calculated by considering the \( 8 \) corners, each with \( 3 \) orientations, and the \( 12 \) edges, each with \( 2 \) orientations.}

For instance, if the cube is held with a yellow top and blue front, the red and orange faces will invariably be to the right and left, respectively. In fact, the red and orange center pieces will \textit{always} be opposites, as will the blue-green and white-yellow pairs of center pieces.\\

\subsection{Notation for Cube Operations}

The notation used to describe the movements and algorithms for solving the Rubik's Cube is standardized to facilitate easy understanding and sharing of solutions. Each face of the cube is designated by an uppercase letter:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{U} - Up (Top Layer)
    \item \textbf{D} - Down (Bottom Layer)
    \item \textbf{L} - Left (Left Layer)
    \item \textbf{R} - Right (Right Layer)
    \item \textbf{F} - Front (Front Layer)
    \item \textbf{B} - Back (Back Layer)
\end{itemize}

The following symbols are appended to these letters to indicate the direction of rotation:

\begin{itemize}
    \item No symbol - 90-degree clockwise rotation
    \item \textbf{'} (apostrophe) - 90-degree counterclockwise rotation
    \item \textbf{2} - 180-degree rotation (either direction)
\end{itemize}

For example, the sequence \textit{L' U' R'} would indicate a counterclockwise rotation of the left layer, followed by a counterclockwise rotation of the top layer, and finally, a counterclockwise rotation of the right layer.

\subsection{God's Number}
In the realm of 3x3x3 Rubik's Cubes, \textit{God's Number} is a term used to denote the maximum number of moves required to solve any scrambled cube. It has been proven that any cube can be solved in 20 moves or fewer (the citation can be found in the \textit{References} section). This concept is an intriguing insight into the mathematical efficiency of the cube's design.

Furthermore, this means that any scramble can be reached with 20 moves or fewer. This is a key point to keep in mind when considering the security of the cube as a cryptographic primitive as well as for key size considerations.\\

\subsection{Combinatorial Explosion with Multiple Cubes}
Let us consider the number of possible states for a single 3x3x3 Rubik's Cube, which is \(43,252,003,274,489,856,000\). When chaining together the combinations of two different cubes, the number of combined states is \((43,252,003,274,489,856,000)^2\).

This squaring occurs because each state of the first cube can pair with every state of the second cube, yielding \(43,252,003,274,489,856,000 \times 43,252,003,274,489,856,000\). Mathematically, the set of possible states becomes the Cartesian product of the two sets of states, leading to an exponential increase in complexity.

One intriguing aspect of chaining multiple Rubik's Cubes is the exponential growth in the state space. Let \( N \) represent the number of unique states for a single Rubik's Cube. For \( k \) chained Rubik's Cubes, the total number of unique states becomes \( N^k \). This exponential increase serves a critical function: it substantially minimizes the likelihood of collisions whilst simultaneously increasing the difficulty of brute-force attacks.

\subsection{Edge and Corner Constraints}

While the utilization of multiple Rubik's Cubes in the encryption scheme introduces a combinatorial explosion in the state space, it is essential to consider the limitations imposed by the unique mapping of plaintext bits to cube pieces. In this scheme, each plaintext bit (either a 0 or 1) is mapped to a specific piece on the cube, which can either be an edge or a corner.

One of the fundamental constraints of a Rubik's Cube is that edges and corners are immutable in their categories; edges cannot morph into corners and vice versa. Due to this constraint, it becomes inappropriate to assign all 48 movable units (54 total units minus 6 centers) to represent bits, as doing so would leave patterns in trivial plaintext-to-ciphertext cryptanalysis attacks.

\subsection{Per-Cube 24-bit State Space}
As a result of the aforementioned limitations, the encryption scheme opts for a more constrained assignment by sticking to either edges or corners to represent the bits. This decision narrows down the number of units used for bit representation to 24, thus limiting the state space to \(2^{24}\) for each cube.

Given the inherent limitations in the state space of a single Rubik's Cube, capped at \(2^{24}\) due to geometric constraints, a novel approach to enlarging this space involves chaining multiple cubes together. Specifically, by employing a tuple of six Rubik's Cubes for each block, the scheme effectively increases the state space to \(2^{24 \times 6}\).

In this enhanced scheme, each block of plaintext is split into six portions, each of which is mapped onto a separate cube. The combined state of all six cubes serves as a unique representation of the original block. This approach leverages the geometric diversity across multiple cubes to create a more complicated and less predictable state space.

The chaining of six cubes per block substantially complicates the task of deciphering the ciphertext without knowledge of the encryption key, thereby augmenting the cryptographic strength of the scheme. With a state space of \(2^{24 \times 6}\), the algorithm becomes computationally prohibitive for brute-force attacks, even when accounting for potential parallelization.

While the increase in state space significantly boosts the algorithm's resilience against attacks, it also introduces additional computational complexity. However, the impact on efficiency is deemed acceptable given the substantial increase in cryptographic security.

\section{Overview}

The proposed encryption scheme is a block cipher that leverages the mathematical complexities and state space of Rubik's Cubes. Each block in the scheme consists of pairs of six 3x3x3 Rubik's Cubes, effectively rendering a block size of 144 bits. At the start of the encryption process, each pair of cubes is initialized to the solved state and then scrambled based on the corresponding plaintext bits.
